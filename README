This is the source behind the new website http://sqlfiddle.com.

It was designed to run with Adobe ColdFusion 9 (although that may soon change to Railo), with PostgreSQL 9 as the backend for the management database.

The framework used for coding the CF code is ColdFusion on Wheels (http://cfwheels.org).  The frontend uses jQuery.

This project itself is intended to be used as a free platform for shared SQL testing and collaborative SQL problem 
solving, similar to http://jsfiddle.net (but for SQL rather than JavaScript, of course).
